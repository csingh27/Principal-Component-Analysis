Task 1:
Preparation:
you might have to install  gtest. E.g. on Ubuntu: “apt-get install libgtest-dev” ✔
 
Task:
Please download the tar.gz file and extract the contents. Inside you'll find a project that you can build with:
 
cd geometry
make all
 
but if you try to build the project, it will fail because not all relevant classes are implemented. Please have a look at the test in test/test_geometries.cpp and implement all missing classes such that the test will run successfully.
 
You can test your implementation by running:
 
cd geometry
make test
 
Please also prepare for questions regarding the code (cmake and C++) we provided. See for example this line of code:
 
"std::list<std::pair<std::unique_ptr<Geometry>, double>> shape_areas;"
 
we might ask e.g.:
What is a list?
What is a unique pointer?
What does the "<...>" notation mean?

Task 2:
Please make a project in which you implement a function that calculates an oriented bounding box around a point set in 3d using principal component analysis. Use only cmake, libeigen and the C++ standard libraries.
